Use /v1/agents/completions endpoint when interacting with a Mistral agent.

The request body must include:

"agent_id" — the agent's unique ID string

"messages" — a list of objects { role: 'user'|'system'|'assistant', content: string }

Do NOT include model — agents define their model internally.

Do not include unsupported fields (e.g. agent_id on /chat/completions, or id inside messages).

Always use application/json content-type.

Route requests through /api/mistral — Vite proxy handles API key securely.

Maintain Axios error handling — catch 422s, 401s, 500s and wrap them in structured messages.

The frontend must never require the user to enter or manage the API key.
